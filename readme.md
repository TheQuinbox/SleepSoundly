My laptop's sound driver, among many others, has this absolutely infuriating behavior where it puts the sound card to sleep after a particular amount of silence (mine's seemingly after 5 seconds), causing a screen reader user to miss the beginning of speech, an audio file, a notification, or anything else they may be trying to listen to. To solve this, this small program was born. Simply run it, and it'll start piping silent audio through your default sound card, thus completely eliminating this aggrivating sleep behavior. It should also respect device changes (e.g. unplugging headphones). To close it, simply click on the tray icon. It doesn't get much simpler than that.
